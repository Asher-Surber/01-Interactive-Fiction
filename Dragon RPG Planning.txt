Original premise: dragon in your typical rpg game. usually dangerous, greedy,
and the mission objective, right? this one, the player, is not. their hoard is mostly made up
of lost belongings they find and are unable to return. they hold onto them to protect them
from unassuming adventurers, hoping that someday they can show the townspeople to their cave
to claim their belongings. one day, a party of adventurers comes to fight the dragon. though the
reason depends on choices, one of them drops a silver locket with pictures of family inside,
and the dragon takes it upon themselves to return it to them. Adventure rpg things ensue.
eventually, locket returned, townspeople trust the dragon and can claim their lost items,
townspeople start to see dragons as individuals now, etc. also have beginnings of a story
behind the adventurer attack and the locket, etc.


Bad ending- fight the townspeople, be the evil dragon they all see
Good ending- return the lost object, trust, show townspeople hoard and let them
find their lost items
Neutral ending- return the lost object, maybe anonymously, return home

implementing hp and inventory, so will need to add events, collectibles,
and flesh out battle scenes


good and neutral endings differentiated by how many kills and how many lost
items returned?    -add kill counter and item counter

if you die, what happens?
